# Question 3

I was unsure of the level of difficulty that the question should be, so I decided to go for a question with two parts that can be given individually or together.

##### Part A:
You are a supplier of wood and own a 20km by 10km forest on which you plant trees. Assume that the trees are equally distributed and that the number of trees tends to infinity. As you want to monitor the forest you set up 158 microphones that each monitor a 1km by 1km area. 

What is the probability of hearing at least one of every 2 trees that fall in the forest sequentially?

##### Part B:
There exits a 4 digit number x, where each digit consists of a unique number. The number x has the following characteristics:

 + The first two digits of x form a prime number.
 + the second two digits are a square.
 + x - 1 is also a prime number.
 + It is divisible by the nearest rounded percentage of part A.
 
What number is x?

# Question 4

## Graph 4.1

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Plot1 <- Graph4_1()
Plot1

```

This first graph gives us a visual representation of the number of surviving passengers in different classes. As can be seen the chances of surviving is lowest for passengers in the lowest class (third), at slightly above 25%. While the passengers in first class had an approximately 62.5% chance of survival. It should also be noted that the number of passengers in the third class significantly outweigh the number of passengers in the first and second class. 

## Graph 4.2

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Plot2 <- Get_Gender_Class_Split()
Plot2

```

It is noticeable from this graph that the percentage of men differ between classes. With the composition becoming more male orientated the lower the class. In the first class it is only slightly male orientated, with 55.42% of the passengers being male. However, in the third class the male percentage rises to 69.53% of the passengers.

## Graph 4.3

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Plot3 <- Graph4_3()
Plot3

```

Here we can see a side by side comparisons of the age compositions of the different classes aboard the Titanic. From this comparison we can see that the third class was composed of a higher percentage of younger people than first or second class. With first class being the least skewed of the three classes.  

## Graph 4.4

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Plot4 <- Graph4_4()
Plot4

```

In this graph we overlap the histogram plots and add a smoothed line to represent the possible underlying distribution. By overlapping the plots we can easily compare the various distributions, from this we can see that the age of third class passengers is more right skewed than the other classes. The first class on the other hand, has a skewness value closer to 0.  

## Graph 4.5

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Plot5 <- Graph4_5()
Plot5

```

We can see from this plot that the men in the third class on-board the titanic was mostly younger men from their teens to early thirties, with the mode age being 21. This suggests that they were passengers that were willing to forego a certain degree of comfort in order to be part of the first journey of the Titanic and to reach America. These are people that might not have been able to afford more expensive means of travel, but wanted to start a new life in America.

## Graph 4.6

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Plot6 <- Graph4_6()
Plot6

```

From this graph it becomes clear that women and children had priority when getting onto lifeboats. Less than 20% of adult men got into lifeboats, while more than 70% of adult women got into lifeboats. It should also be noted that barely more than 50% of children got into lifeboats. This might suggest that preferences might have also fallen along class lines with children from the second and third classes having a lower probability of getting into the lifeboats. This difference in class would also influence the percentage of passengers in the lifeboats as third and second class passenger classes consisted of more men.

# Bonus Question

In order to predict the probability that a passenger survives the Titanic shipwreck, based on prior information, I use a Logistic model that is trained on 80% of the data with 10-fold cross validation. This prediction model is then tested on 20% of the data. The "caret" package in R was used to train and test this model. The data used to train this model consisted of the survived variable as the dependent variable and age, class, sex, fare, sibsp (number of siblings and spouses) and parch (number of parents/children on board). Whether they got into a lifeboat is not included, as a model with this variable included gives an accuracy of 98.56% due to the importance of being in a lifeboat. Thus, we believe a forward looking model from the point of departure is more interesting. 

Although not very aesthetic, I have included a breakdown of the performance of the model on test data, followed by a variable importance plot, which states the most and least important variables in predicting which passengers pass away and which do not.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Plot_Simp_Logit <- No_Boat_Model()
Plot_Simp_Logit

```

This model predicts with an accuracy of 78.47% and finds that the most important predictors of survival are sex, which class they are in and their age. Linearity is not one of the features of a Logistic regression, for that reason the model can predict the probability given a vector of specific inputs, but the coefficients are not as easy to interpret. The coefficients are however still reliable in predicting the correct direction. From this we can see that the person who is most likely to survive is a newborn woman in first class, with no siblings and who had an extremely high fare (550).

Using this model we can also predict individual probabilities. For example, Rose from the movie Titanic (Woman, 1st class, 17, 0 siblings, 500 fare, 1 parent) would have a 98.62% chance of survival based on this model. While Jack Dawson (Man, 3rd class, 20, 0 siblings, 0 fare, 0 parents) only has a 15.54% chance of survival based on this model.

Thank you for the opportunity to do this project and I hope to hear more about this interesting opportunity.
