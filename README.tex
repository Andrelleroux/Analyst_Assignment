This is the introduction section where you can provide an overview of
your analysis.

\hypertarget{question-3}{%
\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}}

I was unsure of the level of difficulty that the question should be, so
I decided to go for a question with two part that can given individually
or together.

This first graph gives us a visual representation of the number of
surviving passengers in different classes. As can be seen the chances of
surviving is lowest for passengers in the lowest class (third), at
slightly above 25\%. While the passengers in first class had an
approximately 62.5\% chance of survival. It should also be noted that
the number of passengers in the third class significantly outweigh the
number of passengers in the first and second class.

It is noticeable from this graph that the percentage of men differ
between classes. With the composition becoming more male orientated the
lower the class. In the first class it is only slightly male orientated,
with 55.42\% of the passengers being male. However, in the third class
the male percentage rises to 69.53\% of the passengers.

Here we can see a side by side comparisons of the age compositions of
the different classes aboard the Titanic. From this comparison we can
see that the third class was composed of a higher percentage of younger
people than first or second class. With first class being the least
skewed of the three classes.
